Generative AI is rapidly reshaping how we build for the web. While chatbots are the most visible application, the real revolution lies in integrating AI deeply into our applications to create truly intelligent and dynamic user experiences.

### From Conversation to Action

Instead of just *talking* to users, modern AI can *do things* for them. The **AI Portfolio Review** tool on this site is a perfect example of this principle. It uses Google's Genkit and the Gemini model to perform a specific, valuable task:

1.  **Analyze**: It ingests a user's project description.
2.  **Critique**: It provides structured, actionable feedback based on the principles of a good portfolio piece.
3.  **Rewrite**: It generates an improved version of the description, showcasing what "better" looks like.
4.  **Extract**: It identifies relevant keywords that a recruiter might be looking for.

This demonstrates a practical, focused use case that provides real value to the user, moving beyond a simple conversational interface.

### The Tech Stack: Genkit and Gemini

This feature is powered by two key pieces of Google technology:

- **Gemini**: A powerful and creative family of large language models (LLMs) that can understand context, reason, and generate high-quality, structured output.
- **Genkit**: An open-source framework designed to simplify the development of production-ready AI-powered features. It provides the tools and abstractions needed to connect to models like Gemini, define structured inputs and outputs using Zod schemas, and create robust, testable AI "flows."

By leveraging tools like Genkit, developers can more easily build sophisticated, AI-driven applications that are reliable, scalable, and deeply integrated into the user experience.
