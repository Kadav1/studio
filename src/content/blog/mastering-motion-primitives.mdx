Animations are a powerful tool in a developer's arsenal. They can guide users, provide feedback, and create a delightful user experience. In the React ecosystem, [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) has emerged as a go-to library for creating production-ready animations.

## The Core Concept: `motion` Components

The heart of Framer Motion is the `motion` component. You can turn any HTML or SVG element into a motion component by prepending `motion.` to it.

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

<motion.div
  animate={{ x: 100, rotate: 90 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
/>
```

This simple example moves a div 100 pixels to the right and rotates it 90 degrees.

## Variants: Reusable Animation Definitions

Writing animation properties inline can get messy. Variants allow you to define animation states and transition between them by name.

```jsx
const variants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
};

<motion.div
  initial="hidden"
  animate="visible"
  variants={variants}
/>
```

This approach is cleaner and more scalable, especially for complex animations involving parent-child relationships.

## AnimatePresence: Handling Enter and Exit Animations

One of the most powerful features of Framer Motion is the `AnimatePresence` component. It enables you to animate components when they are added to or removed from the React tree.

This is essential for things like:
- Animating list items as they are added or removed.
- Creating smooth transitions between pages or views.
- Modals and pop-ups that animate in and out.

By wrapping your conditional components in `AnimatePresence`, you unlock declarative and beautiful exit animations with ease.
