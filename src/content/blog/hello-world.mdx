Hello and welcome!

This is the very first post on my new blog. I'm excited to have a space to share my thoughts, experiments, and learnings in the world of technology and art.

### What to Expect

Here's a little of what I plan to write about:

- **Web Development:** Deep dives into technologies I'm passionate about, like Next.js, TypeScript, and various AI tools. I'll share tutorials, case studies from my projects, and thoughts on best practices.
- **Digital Art:** I'll showcase some of my artwork and occasionally post about my creative process, tools I use (like Procreate and Blender), and sources of inspiration.
- **Tech Insights:** General thoughts on the tech industry, new and exciting tools, and how we can build better, more accessible, and more beautiful digital experiences.

This portfolio itself is a living project. I built it with a modern stack including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN for components, and Genkit for the AI features. I'll be using it as a playground to test new ideas, so expect it to evolve over time.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you'll find the content here interesting and useful.

Stay tuned for more!
