React Server Components (RSCs) are a paradigm shift for web development, and Next.js has embraced them as the default in the App Router. They fundamentally change how we think about rendering and data fetching, leading to faster, more efficient applications. Let's explore why they're so important.

### What are Server Components?

In short, Server Components are React components that run exclusively on the server. They render ahead of time and their JavaScript code is never sent to the client's browser. This is a massive departure from the traditional model where React renders on the server for the initial load (SSR) but then sends all the component code to the client to "hydrate" the page and take over.

### Key Benefits

1.  **Zero Client-Side JavaScript**: By default, every component you create inside the Next.js `app` directory is a Server Component. This means less JavaScript for the user to download, parse, and execute, resulting in a significantly faster initial page load and a more responsive experience, especially on slower devices or networks.

2.  **Direct Backend Access**: Since they run on the server, RSCs can directly access server-side resources. You can query a database, read from the file system, or call a secure API without having to create a separate API endpoint for your front-end to call. This simplifies your architecture and reduces network waterfalls.

3.  **Improved Security**: Any sensitive data or logic, like API keys or private business logic, can be kept safely on the server. Since the component code isn't shipped to the client, you don't have to worry about exposing secrets in your browser-side code.

This entire portfolio is built using Server Components by default. Client-side interactivity is added only where needed (e.g., for animations, forms, or the navigation bar) by using the `'use client'` directive. This "server-first" approach is key to building performant modern web applications.
