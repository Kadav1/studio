Next.js 13 introduced the App Router, and with it, a paradigm shift in how we build React applications: **React Server Components (RSCs)**.

## What are Server Components?

Server Components are a new type of component that runs *exclusively* on the server. They are never downloaded to the client, and their code is not included in the client-side JavaScript bundle.

This has several key advantages:

1.  **Zero Bundle Size:** Because they don't ship any JavaScript to the client, they don't contribute to your app's bundle size. This leads to faster initial page loads.
2.  **Direct Backend Access:** Server Components can directly access server-side resources like databases, filesystems, or internal APIs without needing to create a separate API endpoint. This simplifies data fetching logic.
3.  **Security:** Sensitive data and logic, like API keys or database credentials, can be kept safely on the server and never exposed to the browser.

## Server vs. Client Components

In the Next.js App Router, all components are Server Components by default. To create a component that runs on the client (i.e., a traditional React component with state and effects), you need to opt-in with the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file.

```jsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```
Any component that uses hooks like `useState` or `useEffect` must be a Client Component.

## The Best of Both Worlds

The power of this model lies in the ability to seamlessly interleave Server and Client Components. You can fetch data in a Server Component and pass it as props to an interactive Client Component, getting the best of both worlds: efficient data loading on the server and rich interactivity on the client.
